### Explore the data

The survey data was originally collected and stored in to files available at this link:

[https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/data](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/data)

For this exercise, we will use an integrated `.csv` file that combines data and is a little more structured than the raw `.csv`. This file was downloaded from [kaggle.com](http://www.kaggle.com) at this link:

[2018 survey data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dominoweir/nyc-2018-squirrel-census)

The downloaded file is already added to the class repository in the `data/` folder as as `2018_Central_Park_Squirrel_Census_-_Squirrel_Data.csv`. You can copy this folder to your new repository on your local machine

### Setting up for some squirrely analyses:

1. Create a short name for your group and a new repository for this exercise. Clone the repo to your local machines. 

1. Load the combined datafile (either using the url or from your repository's `../data` directory) using `pd.read_csv()`.

1.  Use standard `df.info()`, `df.head()`, `df.describe()` to explore the data. 

1. Read over the user guide here to understand what the various columns contain.

1. Work together to make a new `.ipynb` in your repo that contains an analysis and simple visualization of the data!
